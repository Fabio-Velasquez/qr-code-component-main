## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- intially wanted to see how far I could've gotten w/o flex or grid... It really wasn't that long. Just use it.

```css
.proud-of-this-flex {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-content: center;
}
```
